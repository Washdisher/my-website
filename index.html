            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Trevor—a 26-year-old with a passion for creativity, the outdoors, and financial independence. Born and raised in Hanson, Massachusetts, I’m currently navigating the exciting yet challenging journey of carving out a fulfilling career and lifestyle that aligns with my values.</p>

        <!-- Professional Background Section -->
        <section id="professional-background">
            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>I recently graduated with a degree in Accounting and Finance, and I’m actively seeking opportunities in the analytics field. My education has equipped me with a strong foundation in financial analysis, data-driven decision-making, and problem-solving. I’m particularly drawn to roles where I can leverage my skills to provide actionable insights and drive business growth.</p>
            <p>While job hunting, I’ve been exploring opportunities in both <a href="https://www.boston.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston</a> and <a href="https://www.visitseattle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle</a>, two cities I’m passionate about for their vibrant cultures and economic opportunities.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Hobbies and Interests Section -->
        <section id="hobbies-interests">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I’m an avid music producer. I work primarily in electronic, house, techno, DnB, rap, and pop genres, using <a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ableton</a> as my DAW of choice. My ultimate goal in music production is to release a body of work that truly reflects my creative vision. Though I’ve been in a bit of a creative rut recently, I’m slowly reigniting that spark and looking forward to getting back into the studio.</p>
            <p>When I’m not producing music, you’ll likely find me outdoors. I’m passionate about mountain and gravel biking, hiking, and fly fishing. I’m a minimalist at heart, so I prefer investing in high-quality gear that lasts. Whether it’s the durability of a well-worn pair of hiking boots or the precision of a fly rod, I believe in owning fewer, better things that can keep up with my adventures.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Personal Philosophy Section -->
        <section id="personal-philosophy">
            <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I’m a firm believer in the importance of balance. Whether it’s managing my finances, maintaining my fitness routine, or pursuing my creative passions, I strive to lead a life that’s both disciplined and fulfilling. I wake up early, usually around 5 AM, to make the most of my day, and I aim to wind down by 10 PM. Exercise is a daily priority for me, whether it’s hitting the trails on my bike or lifting weights to stay strong.</p>
            <p>I’m also on a journey towards self-sufficiency. While I dream of running my own company someday, I’m equally open to other paths that allow me to achieve financial independence and personal fulfillment. Though I’ve faced some setbacks—like a recent breakup and the ongoing challenges of job hunting—I’m committed to staying focused on my long-term goals: to be fit, successful, and, most importantly, happy.</p>

        <!-- Looking Ahead Section -->
        <section id="looking-ahead">
            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>As I continue to build my career and explore my passions, I’m excited about what the future holds. Whether I’m producing my next track, landing that dream job, or simply enjoying a peaceful hike, I’m driven by the desire to live a life that’s both meaningful and aligned with my values.</p>
